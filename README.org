#+TITLE: CSCE 441 Assignment 3
#+AUTHOR: Martin Fracker
* Checklist
TODO
* Platform
* 
- Program written and tested on Linux 64-bit.
- Requires a c++14 compatible compiler
* Makefile
Written for GCC on *nix platforms. Requires libglut, libGL, and libGLU to be in
$PATH
** Changing compile and linking flags
The Makefile can set the environment variables automatically but only if they
are not previously exported. If the Makefile seems to be broken, one or all of
the environment variables probably need to be re-exported.
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ export CXXFLAGS=-std=c++14 -I.
$ export LDFLAGS=-lglut -lGL -lGLU
$ export CXX=g++
$ make all
#+END_SRC
** Running
Run ~./main~ if it exists otherwise it must be compiled. See above if there are
compiler errors.
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ make all
$ ./main
#+END_SRC
